# Challange:
- The application has two pages: "Main" and "History", implemented using React Router.
- The "Main" page displays the 20 most popular images retrieved from the Unsplash API.
- On the "Main" page, there is a text box named "Search" that allows users to update the displayed images based on relevant search terms. The images are updated dynamically as the user types in the search box.
- A caching mechanism is implemented to store previously fetched data. If a user searches for a term that has been searched before, the data is retrieved from the cache instead of making extra API requests.
- The "History" page displays all the search terms used by the user to search for images.
- Infinite scroll functionality is implemented on both the "Main" and "History" pages, allowing users to load more images as they scroll down the page.
- When an image is clicked, a modal window displays the number of downloads, views, and likes, along with the full version of the image.
- The Unsplash API is used for fetching images and related data.
- Infinite scroll functionality is implemented independently, without relying on external libraries.
- TypeScript is used for type safety throughout the application, ensuring better code quality and maintainability.
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
